# dnsproxy-config

[dnsproxy](https://github.com/AdguardTeam/dnsproxy) as a simple service

Example service using AdGuard Team's dnsproxy to provide encrypted transports to existing Pi-hole+Unbound deployments, can be easily modified to purpose.

## Usage
* Install dnsproxy binary

Note: The binaries I compile are for aarch64

If you are using another architecture, grab a binary from the [release page](github.com/AdguardTeam/dnsproxy/releases).
```
sudo wget https://github.com/saint-lascivious/dnsproxy-config/raw/master/usr/local/bin/dnsproxy -P /usr/local/bin/
```

* Create the service configuration directory

Create the /opt/dnsproxy directory
```
sudo mkdir /opt/dnsproxy
```

* Download the configuration file

Note: This file must be edited
```
sudo wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/saint-lascivious/dnsproxy-config/master/opt/dnsproxy/dnsproxy -P /opt/dnsproxy
```

* Install the dnsproxy service file
```
sudo wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/saint-lascivious/dnsproxy-config/master/lib/systemd/system/dnsproxy.service -P /lib/systemd/system
```

* Optional: Change Pi-hole FTL/dnsmasq listening port

If you have enabled listening for tcp/udp 53 in the dnsproxy service configuration file you will need to ensure dnsmasq is not listening on the same port.
```
sudo wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/saint-lascivious/dnsproxy-config/master/etc/dnsmasq.d/99-listening-port.conf -P /etc/dnsmasq.d
```

Restart Pi-hole
```
pihole restartdns
```

* Start the dnsproxy service

Enable the service
```
sudo systemctl enable dnsproxy
```

Start the service
```
sudo systemctl dnsproxy start
```
